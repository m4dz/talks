==Hume's Guillotine==:<br>The is-ought problem

???

- We can't deduce normative statements (what ought to be) from positive statement (what is)
- Means morality, and ethic choices, can't be infered from any is statement
- So ethics can't come from logic, but from the relation between the Humans, and the algorithms
