Industrial {.large}

- Laborers replaced by the machines
- Social gropus changed
- Is it ethically acceptable to remove work from workers?

???

- people didn't disappeared
- humanity improved
- it was at social cost

===
<!--{.large}-->

Digital {.large}

- Human choices replaced by algorithms
- Tedious tasks belongs to the machines
- Is it ethically acceptable consider some people time is most valuable than others?

???

- Choices aren't decisions
- when we let machine make an appointment, there's a real people on the other side
- when we use a deliveroo service, we consider our time is most valuable than the time of the deliverer

???

- have we got power enough?
- maybe we could impact more people
- we craft and ship code to million of people
- but except for large companies, have we got a real impact?
- in large companies, decisions aren't made by developers!
- so aren't we the workers of the digital age?
