Thinking about Ethics<br>is an elite issue

???

- Interesting
- But thinking about ethics is a richpeople problem
- Craftspeople don't have time

> True morality has no time for morality
>
> <cite>Blaise Pascal</cite>

- thinking about ethic doesn't imply about morality
- ethics isn't a value for society

<!--{.punchline}-->

Scientific approach isn't Ethical approach

- science analyze facts to think about hypothesis

::Choice::{.fragment .fade-up} _vs._ ::Decision::{.fragment .fade-up}

- choice means you have to select between existing hypothesis
- decision implies you have to bring your own morality in the balance (which machines can't do)
