## So, what do we do now?

???

So, time to conclude (because the coffee is cooling right now). What do we do?

Never play the sorcerer's apprentice

First: never ever play the sorcerer's apprentice. Cryptography is a hard job, dedicated to maths. It requires many skills that most people can't pretend to have, myself included. Don't try to reinvent the wheel. Be confident to crypto-developers, and use their open source work.

Never forget that

1. Security has an inverse relation to the ==ease of use==
2. Security has a ==cost==

Second: never forget that security has an inverse relation to simplicity. The more you increase your security, the more it will be complicated to use to your users. It means security come at a cost. In time, in UX, in money. You have to adjust the cursor between all those params.

My last slide is about this Reddit post. It released during the Ashley Madison leaks. The dating platform's database, with personal data about its customers, became available on the Internet

This guy said that he lived in the USA for studies. He's gay and used Ashley Madison platform to meet people. Now, he's returned in its country, Saudi Arabia, where homosexuality is punished by death. He's scared for his life because the data leak can reveal who he is, what is his sexual orientation, and where he lives.

I'm sure that Ashley Madison's developers didn't though they may compromise somebody's life when they wrote their codebase. But, it is. So, even if security isn't a simple thing, it's time to stop to be scared, and to protect.

Thank you.
